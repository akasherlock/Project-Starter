#To-do list application

## Introduction

- My to-do list application keeps track of things to do and crosses things off when they are done.
- This application can be used by anyone who likes to plan their to-do work accordingly. Example: Students tracking their assignments
- As a student myself, it's not easy to keep track of due assignments, deadlines, etc. One can easily forget about their work due to a heavy workload. 
- This application is designed to help students like myself so that they can efficiently keep track of their to-do work. It is also usable generally and can be used for keeping track of to-do items.
